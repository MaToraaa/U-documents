# 📄 U-Document

U-Document is a powerful document management application designed to enhance collaborative writing and editing. With U-Document, users can effortlessly create, save, edit, delete, and share documents in real-time. The application provides flexible collaboration features, allowing users to work together seamlessly with permission settings that support both "can view" and "can edit" modes.
